**Brief Project Description:**

A visual-based programming language that allows users to interact primarily with the mouse to drag and drop input functions/variables that will provide instructions on what the player will do inside the rocket simulation game.

The visual programming language will be implemented inside a web browser and the rocket simulation game will be in another language domain (possibly Java). A draft representation of what the program might look like later in the project can be found within this [issue](https://gitlab.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/course-work/project489/2020/chheanchan/visual-programming-language/issues/2).
